## Welcome to clio

clio is a browser plugin that will process search history and recommend books based on articles that youâ€™ve read.
### Idea

Recommending books based on your search activity (specific) search history. Aim is to base this on a differentially private ML to make media recommendations.

### Why was it created?

While selecting a book we generally tend to pickup something that might be recommend by someone else, but it might not be what you need right now. This plugin was built to recommend a book based on interests and the things you love to read!
